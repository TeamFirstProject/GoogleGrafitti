[Google Graffiti](https://teamfirstproject.github.io/GoogleGrafitti/) is a group project for UC Berekely Extended Education coding camp, created by [Dennis Tam](https://github.com/saikay), [Harry Neakok](https://github.com/Harryneakok), [Joshua Moore](https://github.com/joshmoore2003), and [Justin Honegger](https://github.com/Skarrggit).

The goal of the project was to make a simple, location-based chat program. To accomplish this, we used Google API and Firebase as a chat backend.

The user can click on any of the Google Maps markers existing on the screen and enter a chat room for that location. They can also click on the map to create a new marker and chat room.
